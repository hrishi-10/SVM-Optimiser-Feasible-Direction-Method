# Support Vector Machine Optimization via Feasible Direction Method  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project addresses the implementation and analysis of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using the **Feasible Direction Method** for constrained optimization. The aim is to solve both hard-margin and soft-margin SVM problems under bounded constraints.

The key tasks include:  
- Formulating the SVM optimization problem and interpreting decision variables, objectives, and constraints.  
- Applying the feasible direction iterative algorithm with bound constraints.  
- Implementing the method in Python and validating on the Iris dataset for binary classification of Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor.  
- Extending the approach to soft-margin SVM with slack variables and proposing a multi-class classification scheme.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives and Deliverables

- **Question 1:** Define decision variables, objective function, and constraints for the hard-margin SVM.  
- **Question 2:** Develop the feasible direction method steps for solving the bounded SVM problem.  
- **Question 3:** Implement the algorithm in Python, tuning parameters such as tolerance (Îµ) and bound (M), and evaluate performance on the Iris dataset.  
- **Question 4:** Extend the formulation to soft-margin SVM and propose a multi-class SVM classification algorithm.
